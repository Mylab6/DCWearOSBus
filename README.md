# DCWearOSBus
Hi all, here's a basic Wear OS app which tries to predict bus times in Washington DC. To get this to work you'll need to setup ether a direct connection to the DC metro API, or setup a API which serves the data to this client.
See:

If you'd like to set your own server up, feel free to checkout my implimentation in the lambda folder( I used AWS ). 

Edit this file to set your API
